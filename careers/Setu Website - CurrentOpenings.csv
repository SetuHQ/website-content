About Setu
Setu is working to reimagine financial products for the next billion users.
How do you put a dent in India’s economy when most of her population cannot afford insurance,
credit, investments, etc. through the formal channels that you and I take for granted? Our
auto-wallas cannot use Cred, our security guards cannot use Zerodha. There are several
examples—you get the idea.
How can we enable them to get on such platforms?
By reducing the cost of distribution If we break down financial products such as loans, insurance and
investments into their fundamental building blocks, and offer them as APIs to businesses, they then
package these APIs into highly custom apps, tailor-made for their specific customers, instead of a
generic one-size-for-all approach that is the norm today.
This also enables them to go live with a fintech product or service in a matter of days, not months.
We believe that fintech will be a core part of every company’s offering. And at Setu, we’re building
the fintech infrastructure that will accelerate this.
More about Setu
Setu is an acquired entity of Pine Labs, one of the fastest growing fintech companies in India and
